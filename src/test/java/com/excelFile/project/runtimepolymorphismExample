String excelFilePath = "C:/Users/annur/OneDrive/Documents/DBTables.xlsx";
        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(excelFilePath);
             Workbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis)) {

            Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);.........................................is this an example of polymorphism ij java


ChatGPT said:
Yes, your example does demonstrate polymorphism in Java ‚Äî specifically, runtime polymorphism (also called dynamic method dispatch).

Let's break it down:

üìò Code Snippet:

Workbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);
Here:

Workbook is the interface.

XSSFWorkbook is the concrete implementation of that interface.

workbook.getSheetAt(0) is a method call via the interface type, resolved at runtime based on the actual object (XSSFWorkbook).

‚úÖ Why is this Polymorphism?
This line is a classic example of runtime polymorphism:

You declared the object as the super type (Workbook).

You instantiated it using the subclass (XSSFWorkbook).

Java will decide at runtime which getSheetAt() method to call (from the actual XSSFWorkbook implementation).

üß† What kind of polymorphism is this?
Type	Description	Your Example

1.Compile-time polymorphism	Method overloading	‚ùå Not this one

2.Runtime polymorphism	Method overriding via superclass reference	‚úÖ Yes, this is it

üí° Bonus: Why use this?
Using the interface type (Workbook) increases flexibility and allows you to switch implementations easily, like:

java
Copy
Edit
Workbook workbook = new HSSFWorkbook(fis); // For .xls files
Workbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis); // For .xlsx files
This is useful in frameworks like Apache POI, where .xls and .xlsx use different underlying classes.
=============================================
 What is Dynamic Polymorphism?
Also known as:

Runtime Polymorphism

Dynamic Method Dispatch

It occurs when:

A parent class or interface reference is used to call a method overridden by a subclass.

The actual method that gets called is determined at runtime, based on the object's actual type, not the reference type.
